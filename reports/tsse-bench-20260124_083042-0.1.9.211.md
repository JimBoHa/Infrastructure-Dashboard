## Results

### Candidate generation
- p50: 15 ms
- p95: 19 ms
- Notes: `candidate_gen_ms` from job timings.

### Qdrant search
- p50: 8 ms
- p95: 11 ms
- Notes: sum of `qdrant_search_ms` across widening stages/vectors.

### Preview endpoint
- p50: 34 ms
- p95: 44 ms
- Notes: preview wall time for top candidate/episode.

### Exact stage throughput
- p50: 168.05 candidates/sec
- p95: 174.95 candidates/sec
- exact_stage_ms p50/p95: 482 / 555 ms
- Notes: candidates/sec based on `duckdb_candidate_ms + scoring_ms + episode_extract_ms`.

### End-to-end job latency
- p50: 930 ms
- p95: 1235 ms
- Notes: wall time from job submission to completion.

### Resource usage
- Process: `core-server`
- CPU peak: 88.1 %
- RAM peak: 98 MB
- Disk IO read/write: — / — MB
- Notes: best-effort sampling of monitored process.

## Artifacts

- Raw logs: (not captured)
- JSON summary: (not captured)

## Notes

- `candidate_gen_ms`, `duckdb_candidate_ms`, `scoring_ms`, and `episode_extract_ms` come from the job’s `timings_ms` payload.
- Targets are sourced from `docs/ADRs/0006-time-series-similarity-engine-(tsse)-on-controller-similarity-search.md` when available; other targets are CLI-provided.
- Resource sampling uses process statistics and may be unavailable on some systems.
- Interval (effective) is read from job result params (auto-clamped horizons may override the requested interval).
