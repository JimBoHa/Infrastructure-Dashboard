## Results

### Candidate generation
- p50: 16 ms
- p95: 37 ms
- Notes: `candidate_gen_ms` from job timings.

### Preview endpoint
- p50: 24 ms
- p95: 26 ms
- Notes: preview wall time for top candidate/episode.

### Exact scoring throughput
- p50: — candidates/sec
- p95: — candidates/sec
- scoring_ms p50/p95: 0 / 0 ms
- Notes: candidates per second based on `scoring_ms`.

### End-to-end job latency
- p50: 918 ms
- p95: 923 ms
- Notes: wall time from job submission to completion.

### Resource usage
- Process: `core-server`
- CPU peak: — %
- RAM peak: — MB
- Disk IO read/write: — / — MB
- Notes: best-effort sampling of monitored process.

## Artifacts

- Raw logs: (not captured)
- JSON summary: (not captured)

## Notes

- `candidate_gen_ms` and `scoring_ms` come from the job’s `timings_ms` payload.
- Targets are sourced from `docs/ADRs/0006-time-series-similarity-engine-(tsse)-on-controller-similarity-search.md` when available; other targets are CLI-provided.
- Resource sampling uses process statistics and may be unavailable on some systems.
- Interval (effective) is read from job result params (auto-clamped horizons may override the requested interval).
