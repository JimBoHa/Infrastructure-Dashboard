Ticket: Visualize Predictive Alarms in Dashboard
Title: [Feature] Visualize Predictive Alarms and Anomaly Indicators in apps/dashboard-web
Description:
Following the integration of the anomaly detection model in the core server, the web dashboard must be updated to distinguish between standard threshold-based alarms and new predictive alarms. Users need to clearly identify when an alarm is "predicted" (preventative) versus "active" (reactive) to take appropriate preemptive action.
Scope:
* Alarm List Update: Modify the existing Alarms view to handle the new alarm metadata coming from the API. These alarms should be visually distinct (e.g., different severity badge, icon, or color coding) to indicate they are generated by the AI model.
* Contextual Details: Ensure the alarm detail view exposes the "anomaly score" or confidence level if provided by the API response, allowing the user to understand the urgency.
* Trend Visualization (Optional/Scope Dependent): If the API exposes the anomaly data points alongside standard trends, overlay these on the existing charts in the Trends tab to show where the model detected the deviation.
Technical Context:
* The application is a Next.js app (apps/dashboard-web).
* It currently consumes alarms via /api/alarms.
* The backend alarm object structure has likely changed or been extended (see backend ticket). The frontend types/interfaces must be updated to reflect this.
Acceptance Criteria:
* Predictive alarms appear in the main Alarms list but are visually differentiated from standard hard-threshold alarms.
* Filtering logic (if present) allows users to toggle between "All," "Standard," and "Predictive" views.
* The UI gracefully handles cases where anomaly data might be missing (backwards compatibility).
* npm run lint and npm run test pass with the new UI components.
Notes for Developer:
* Check apps/dashboard-web/.env.local to ensure you are pointing to a local core server instance that actually generates these new alarm types for testing.
* Coordinate with the backend engineer to confirm the exact JSON shape of the new alarm properties (e.g., is_predictive, origin: "ml", etc.).
