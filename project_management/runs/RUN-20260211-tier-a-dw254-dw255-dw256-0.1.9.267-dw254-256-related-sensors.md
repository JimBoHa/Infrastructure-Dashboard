### Visual checks (required)

- [x] PASS: `trends_matrix_profile_sent_focus.png` Pattern Detector shows “Send to Related Sensors” and confirms focus windows were sent; shared-window indicator (“In Related Sensors”) is visible and not clipped.
- [x] PASS: `trends_related_sensors_pattern_focus_advanced.png` Related Sensors shows explicit-focus banner, “Evidence source” disclosure, Stability tier/score, and Evidence health summary with readable layout.
- [x] PASS: `related_sensors_how_it_works.png` In-app help page renders with consistent card layout; warning callout and tooltips copy are visible with no overflow.
- [x] PASS: `trends_related_sensors_large_scan.png` Related Sensors panel loads and the operator key/help content is readable; candidate list layout follows existing dashboard conventions.
- [x] PASS: `trends_related_sensors_scanning.png` Results + preview pane render without overlapping content; diagnostic and evidence blocks remain readable.

### Findings

- No severe/moderate issues found in reviewed screenshots.
- Minor: some long-card content requires scrolling on smaller viewports, but controls remain usable and consistent with Trends conventions.

### Reviewer declaration

I viewed each screenshot listed above.
