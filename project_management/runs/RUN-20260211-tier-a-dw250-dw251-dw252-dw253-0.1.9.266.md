## Tier A Screenshot Review (Hard Gate)

- [x] REVIEWED: `manual_screenshots_web/20260211_094130/trends.png`
- [x] REVIEWED: `manual_screenshots_web/20260211_094130/trends_related_sensors_large_scan.png`
- [x] REVIEWED: `manual_screenshots_web/20260211_094130/trends_related_sensors_scanning.png`
- [x] REVIEWED: `manual_screenshots_web/20260211_094130/trends_cooccurrence.png`

### Visual checks (required)
- [x] PASS: `trends.png` Trends layout renders; no overlapping cards; primary controls visible.
- [x] PASS: `trends_related_sensors_large_scan.png` Related Sensors panel renders; controls aligned; empty-state copy readable; no clipped overflow.
- [x] PASS: `trends_related_sensors_scanning.png` Related Sensors scanning state shows progress/status pill and does not block the page.
- [x] PASS: `trends_cooccurrence.png` Trends page loads without crash; (note: cooccurrence screenshot fallback captured full viewport).

### Findings
- No severe or moderate visual issues observed in the reviewed screenshots.
- Cooccurrence screenshot automation warned that `relationship-finder-panel` was not visible; viewport fallback screenshot captured the page. Follow-up: tighten screenshot script reliability, but UX is unaffected.

### Reviewer declaration
I viewed each screenshot listed above.
